    <h1>DAY-1 REVISION CLASSES</h1>
    <h1 >Question 1</h1>
    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
    <br>
    <br>

    Javascript is a scripting language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.
    Javascript is a single threaded synchronous language.
    javascript is an interpreter language that mean where our code is going is going to run line by line.
    javascript id executing line by line.
    it is a combination of both the complier and interpreter.

     <h1>Question 2</h1>

    <h2>What is Run Time Environment?</h2>
    <br>
    <br>

    The runtime environment is what makes JavaScript code work, and in a browser in consists of the JS engine, a lot of Web APIs, a callback queue and the event loop.
     The JS engine translates source code into machine code that allows a computer to perform specific tasks at the hardware level.
    It consists of:
    Parser: It checks whether the syntax is correct or not and returns back in case of errors.
    AST(Abstract Syntax Tree): It divides the codes into parts to execute.
    Compilation:Here,,It whole code is going to be converted into machine level language. 

    <h1>Question 3</h1>

    
    <h2>What are javascript Engines?</h2>
    <br>
    <br>

A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.
 JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one.
 The first JavaScript engine was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 for the Netscape Navigator web browser. It was a rudimentary interpreter for the nascent language Eich invented. (This evolved into the SpiderMonkey engine, still used by the Firefox browser.)

The first modern JavaScript engine was V8, created by Google for its Chrome browser. V8 debuted as part of Chrome in 2008, and its performance was much better than any prior engine.The key innovation was just-in-time compilation, which can significantly improve execution times.

Other browser vendors needed to overhaul their interpreters to compete. Apple developed the Nitro engine for its Safari browser, which had 30% better performance than its predecessor. Mozilla leveraged portions of Nitro to improve its own SpiderMonkey engine.

<h1>Question 4</h1>

<h2>What is Execution Context ?</h2>
<br>
<br>

The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in its execution. During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables and functions are stored in memory,
 executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets executed.
 <br>
 <br>
 There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:
<br>
Global Execution Context (GEC)
<br>
Function Execution Context (FEC)
<br>
<br>
Global Execution Context:-Whenever the JavaScript engine receives a script file, it first creates a default Execution Context known as the Global Execution Context (GEC).

                  The GEC is the base/default Execution Context where all JavaScript code that is not inside of a function gets executed.
<br>
<br>
Function Execution Context:-Whenever a function is called, the JavaScript engine creates a different type of Execution Context known as a Function Execution Context (FEC) within the GEC to evaluate and execute the code within that function.

                  Since every function call gets its own FEC, there can be more than one FEC in the run-time of a script.
